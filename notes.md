The petitioner failed to meet the evidentiary criteria for extraordinary ability under 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(o)(3)(iv)(A) or (B). The beneficiary, who has been training in voice and opera since 2007 in South Korea and the United States, had performance experiences and received awards in both countries; however, these awards were not deemed nationally or internationally significant. The evidence presented did not establish the beneficiary's eligibility as an individual with extraordinary ability in the arts. The documented performances were primarily in a student context rather than in professional productions with distinguished reputations. Awards received were considered local or regional, lacking national or international recognition. Published materials referenced were mainly related to student showcases, lacking major critical reviews or acknowledgments. Testimonials from colleagues and former teachers praised the beneficiary's talent but fell short of demonstrating significant recognition or extraordinary ability. The petitioner also failed to provide evidence of commanding a high salary or commercial success in comparison to peers in the field. The petitioner disputed the significance of the beneficiary's awards and performances, arguing for their national or international stature, but the Administrative Appeals Office dismissed the appeal, upholding the acting director's decision of denial due to insufficient evidence meeting the regulatory criteria. Overall, the petitioner did not meet the burden of proof to establish the beneficiary's eligibility for the O-1 nonimmigrant classification as an individual with extraordinary ability in the arts.", datetime.date(2015, 4, 3)
